# Gesture Recognition Using Oculus Quest 2 built-in hand tracking

This project is created in name of my Graduation Work at Digital Arts and Entertainement.

Virtual Reality is a growing platform where many controller input approaches are waiting to be explored. One of these yet-to-be-explored controls is the simple use of oneâ€™s hands without a physical controller. Some VR-headset already internally support built-in hand tracking, like the Oculus Quest 2 which I would like to use for this research. Additionally, with the use of their Oculus-SDK, simple hand poses can be recognized and used as an input command by analysing the joint positions and rotations of the fingers and hands. An even bigger challenge is recognizing complete hand gestures. (This often gets confused as a hand pose but it is not the same, a gesture is a movement.)

The use of poses can replicate simple gestures; however, more complex gestures will be hard to differentiate from each other. In the latter case, training sets can help to create a more in dept gesture recognition system. During this research, I would like to investigate and research the different methods to recognize gestures in VR and look at how multiple methods can be combined to create an optimal user experience. Furthermore, as a stretch goal, I would like to compare how challenging it is to implement these methods in Unity, Unreal Engine, and a C++ project using the Oculus SDK.
